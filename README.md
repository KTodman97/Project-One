# Toxic Situation: A Bi-Coastal Perspective

Project Description/Outline: Our project is to shine light on the amount of pollution on the Western and Eastern Coastal Regions of the United States. We'll examine relationships between the types of pollutants found on each coast, along with the factors that may impact the amounts.

Hypothesis:
There would be more non-point sources of pollutants on the West Coast due to an assumed higher population density, GDP, and environmental regulation over the course of 5 years beginning in 2014.

Leading Questions:
1.  How much non-point pollution is on each coast by state that could impact these results?

	Non-point - oceanconservancy website

2.  What is the population density for each state along the coasts that could impact these results?

	Census.gov

3.  What is the total estimated GDP for each state along the coasts that could impact these results?

4.  What states have environmental laws or regulations that could impact these results?
